The code within is associated to the manuscript "Experimental characterization of multi-pathway diffusion of lithium in feldpsar" submitted to Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta. These codes were used to numerically model Li diffusion in feldspar experiments to calibrate the diffusivity of Li. The code is intended to run with an associated excel file that contains the Li concentration data and distance data. A sample Li profile is provided.
